I&nbsp;write applications primarily using **JavaScript** ,front-ends using **React**, design backend services in **FastAPI** or **Node.js**

I&nbsp;have completed Bachelor's of Engineering focused in Information Technology.

As a software engineer, I have always been inspired by the idea of building cool and innovative things that people would use. Lately i have been learning **Machine Learning** and trying to build AI driven applications.

Outside of work, you can find me playing football, solving chess puzzles, or exploring new places. If you'd like to connect or discuss anything, feel free to reach out via email at [ranveer2001s@gmail.com.](mailto:ranveer2001s@gmail.com.)
